# Project Overview

# User Stories/Goals

**Agile**

This was the second time I practiced agile in the development and planning of my project.
I created a list of user stories to assist in the development and implementation writing code and building the website. Each user story breaks up the project in to small chunks which can be tackled individually, eventually each on the back of the previous to build a complete working site. With each user story only a part of the site is worked on. With each user story completed, I moved on to the next and would then run in to bugs and errors which would require fixing before moving on.

**Project Goals**

1. To create a website that is easy to navigate and use.
2. To create a website that is visually appealing.
3. To create a website that is responsive on all devices.
4. To create a website that is interactive.
5. To create a website that is fun to use.
6. To create a website that is easy to use.

1. I want to easily understand the product and whats being offered.
2. I want to understand the company and thier ethics.

# UX/UI  

## Design

### Main colours used

### Font colour

### Fonts used
     
  - **Pacifico**
    I used Pacifico because it has a nice, jovial feel to it. It's not too serious and lets the user know the site and the brand is friendly and easy going.
    
  - **Roboto**
    I used Rototo because it has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly        and open curves. 
    
  - **Lato**
    I used Lato because it's serious but friendly. It is a humanist sans-serif typeface and pairs well with Robot.
