# Project Overview

Planet Market is a e-commerce website produced for my fifth and final portfolio project for Code Institute's Full Stack Software Development course. The main goal of this project is to create a full-stack website using Django AND AWS. The website is an online shop where users can browse and purchase electronic and digital hardware. The website is fully responsive and has a contemporary design with minal fonts and colour palette. 

# User Stories/Goals

**Agile**

This was the second time I practiced agile in the development and planning of my project.
I created a list of user stories to assist in the development and implementation writing code and building the website. Each user story breaks up the project in to small chunks which can be tackled individually, eventually each on the back of the previous to build a complete working site. With each user story only a part of the site is worked on. With each user story completed, I moved on to the next and would then run in to bugs and errors which would require fixing before moving on.
